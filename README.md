# project description
Our project’s aim is to create a client-server project that acts as a community hub; in other words, a volunteer network. With the use of the Google API, based on one’s location, we will display donation centers (good will, salvation army), community fridges, and non-profit organization centers. When local organizations are in need of volunteers, sanitary products, etc., they can create a posting in order to gain traction in the community. Ideally, we will implement two logins: one for organizations to post their events and projects and one for users to find community events near them.We will also use the Google API to display the location of local volunteer projects that are in need of participants and/or attendees. There already exists websites where volunteer services are provided, however, our aim is to be a medium through which organizations can get in contact with locals and vice versa. And, in the future, we also plan on creating an interface where the client can provide a word and/or phrase and a thread will be displayed based on their input. Our goal is to create a platform that can continuously be improved upon in order to give nonprofits and communities an efficient space to manage and promote their efforts. 

**Actions** 
We want to enable Login capabilities for users. For extra functionality, we would like all users to be able to chat with one another in a public commenting section, as well as send private messages to one another. Additionally, users should be able to make posts, like posts (so that they can refer back to them later on), and share them through any medium.

**SETUP**
Currently, `make prod` commits and pushes to GitHub, and `make dev_end` executes the announcement "Installing developer requirements". Later on, what it will do is download everything you need to run the environment.


**Actionable Requirements**
There are two types of users for this system: community members and local organizations.
* Each user can:
  * Register in the system
  * Create a profile
* Users of type Local Organization can:
  * Create an event
  * Create a post
* Users of type Community Member can:
  * Comment on a post
  * Like a post
  * Save an event
